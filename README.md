# KEYBoard inhibITOR
Ever wanted to upgrade your laptop keyboard with something a bit more confortable? Want to be able to lay your fine clacker on your mushy domer without risking the keybocalypse?

Keybitor is your solution : a windows driver filter that discards input from your PS2 keyboard when active. It is provided with a full suite of powerfull software to inhibit your keyboard on demande, dynamically or automatically :

 * KeybitorCmd : a simple console application to toggle the keyboard
 * KeybitorConfig : install the driver, enable persistence across reboots and launching the tray widget on windows startup
 * KeybitorTray : toggle the keyboard by double-clicking a simple tray icon
 * libKeybitor : if you're hardcore and want a simple interface to toggle a keyboard from a custom software

On install of the driver, a prompt will warn you of an unsigned driver : this is to be expected as signing a driver for windows is a pretty expensive process.

Tested on Windows 7 x86 and x64. Don't hesitate to confirm if it works on your system or open an issue if it doesn't.
